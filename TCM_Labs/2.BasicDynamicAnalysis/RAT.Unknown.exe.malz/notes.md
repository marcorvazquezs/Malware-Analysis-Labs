- GET request for `msdcorelib.exe` to `serv1.ec2-102-95-13.2-ubuntu.local`

## Host Indicators 
- Running procmon to find host indicators filtering using `Process Name == RAT.Unknown.exe` and `Operation contains File`
- Looking for PATH found in strings - `AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

- Looks like it is writing a file called `mscordll.exe` 
- GET request was for `msdcorelib.exe`
  - Having a `dll` being called an `.exe` is suspicious 
  - Written into startup directory might be a way of achieving persistence by making this run on startup
- Found the `mscordll.exe` file in the suspected path
